This file contains data generated by running the remote_submission_scripts on rasters of the whole state of Oregon and Florida. 
First the data was subset into ecoregions, and then each disturbance in the ecoregion raster was analzed for size, 
interior/ total ratio, disturbance type etc. Each csv file is tied to one of the ecoregions examined. 
The one exception is disturb2014.csv, which is just the lable csv downloaded from LANDFIRE that matches ID #'s from the rasters to disturbance type. 
It is included here for context.
