This contains the scripts used to generate the Emperical Analysis section of the paper. 
Draft_of_likelyhood.Rmd 
  -   Has the likelyhood equations of the different functional forms we considerd useing. 
  -   This scripts is how Supplemental figure 1 was generated. 
  
 emperical_analysis_without_MLE_fits.Rmd
 - has data qa/qc
 - helper functions to plot upper (most compact) and lower (most linear) ratio bounds
 - has data summary statistics (Supplemental table 1)
 - Code to generate suplemental figure 2
 - KS size distribution tests (Suplemental table 2) 
 - Parameter from MLE fits quality control
 - Plots of curve fits
 - plots of size distributions
 
 Sensitivity_of_mle_fits.Rmd
 - Runs Likelyhood ratio tests on all models and exports results into csv files
 - Takes a long time to run
